# Recipe-Generator-Using-GenAI
This project uses Gemini's API to take in the user input like ingredients available, cuisine type, time and complexity to generate a recipe which the user can use to start their cooking journey! 

The
 proposed solution addresses key challenges in meal planning and
 preparation by leveraging large language models to generate
 customized recipes based on user-specified parameters including
 available ingredients, cuisine preferences time constraints etc.
 The implementation employs a modular architecture facilitating
 ingredient analysis and recipe structure generation. The system
 significantly reduces food waste by optimizing ingredient utiliza
tion while simultaneously expanding usersâ€™ culinary repertoires
 through contextually appropriate suggestions. This research con
tributes to the growing field of practical GenAI applications by
 providing an accessible, user-focused implementation that trans
forms everyday meal planning. Performance metrics indicate
 improved efficiency in recipe discovery compared to traditional
 search-based approaches, with particular advantages for users
 with limited ingredient availability.
